## Authors

This is a template on using hardhat to deploy, interact or anything.
It'll be update regularly when I have some time on it

## Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
npx hardhat test ./testfile
```

## Additionally you can run the predefined tasks
```shell
npx hardhat deploy <contractName> <contract args>
```
